This is concerning on many levels, but most of all the uncertainty of whom these weapons are meant for. Legitimate shipments to support the Kabul government would not have to be ‘secretly’ flown in. That leads to the concern that the weapons could be destined for anti-Pakistan terrorists based in Afghanistan.⁠\n⁠\nWhile some have also raised questions over the legitimacy of the evacuation flights, we believe this is a case of using a real problem as cover for questionable actions, rather than using an invented problem. Bear in mind that the Taliban are claiming that they now control 85% of the country. This includes much of the city of Kandahar — from where India says it evacuated 50 consulate staffers.
